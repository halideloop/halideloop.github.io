I am not really sure why I have given myself more work to do. Maybe it's because I have more energy than I did in December. Maybe I feel my birthday looming like a supercell over the plains. Maybe I just want to use more parts of my own name to claim the parts of my energy dispersed across the internet.<!--more-->

My life tends to revolve around projects. Limited interests within special interests. I can hold them for as long as I'm working on them. Right now, I am planning on pushing out a poem every day in April here, because it's just good practice. On top of that, I'm working on material for my next project - not just poems, but prose, drawings, art. I've been giving thought to the publishing world, and while I plan on continuing to submit work, my important-to-me work will be handled on my own. Trust issues. Control issues. But also just how I need to communicate.

When I launched THIS DESERT WAS AN OCEAN, I hadn't expected a large response, but my hope was that I wouldn't have to shill the project repeatedly. I don't care about money or copies sold. I care about freedom to distribute.
