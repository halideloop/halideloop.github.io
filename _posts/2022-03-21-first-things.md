I am not really sure why I have given myself more work to do. Maybe it's because I have more energy than I did in December. Maybe I feel my birthday looming like a supercell over the plains. Maybe I just want to use more parts of my own name to claim the parts of my energy dispersed across the internet.<!--more-->

My life tends to revolve around projects. Limited interests within special interests. I can hold them for as long as I'm working on them. Right now, I am planning on pushing out a poem every day in April here, because it's just good practice. On top of that, I'm working on material for my next project - not just poems, but prose, drawings, art. Things are made to go together.

I've been giving thought to the publishing world, and while I plan on continuing to submit work, my important-to-me work will be handled on my own. Trust issues. Control issues. But also just how I need to communicate. When I launched THIS DESERT WAS AN OCEAN, I hadn't expected a large response, but my hope was that I wouldn't have to shill the project repeatedly. I don't care about money or copies sold. I care about freedom to distribute. Connection from others comes second to me because it always has. It's been a struggle, and it pleases me when it happens, but really, I think I'd be deluding myself to think everything I write will embed itself in some stranger's mind. So, free poems, free art, free everything. 

I'm here on GitHub because I'm reopening my long-paused projects involving generative art and generative text. Maybe other things in the future. I feel like this is a part of myself that I don't talk about, and hope it can change. I love programming and computers. I am very much in love with BASIC and R and JavaScript and Lua and Scheme. If you're here for words and don't know what these are, it's totally okay, because all you really need to know is they can do really neat things. 

This is all to say, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, but I intend on having a good time.
